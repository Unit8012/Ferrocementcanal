<h1>Ferrocement Canal Lining</h1>
<p>Ferrocement or Ferro-concrete is a system of reinforced mortar or plaster applied over layers of metal[^1^][2]. It is a composite material used to form thin sections, composed of a mortar, reinforcement include light steel fabrics and meshes[^1^][2].</p>
<p>Ferrocement canal lining is a type of hard surface canal lining that has some advantages over other types of linings, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has good strength and resistance to impact, fire, earthquake, and corrosion[^1^][2].</li>
<li>It is relatively economical and does not require skilled workers or framework[^1^][2].</li>
<li>It can be constructed over any temporary framework in any desired shape[^1^][2].</li>
<li>It can cover the wide range of applications due to the low self-weight[^1^][2].</li>
</ul>
<p>Ferrocement canal lining consists of a layer of ferrocement applied over a base layer of compacted earth or soil-cement. The thickness of the ferrocement layer varies from 10 to 25 mm depending on the design and loading conditions[^1^][2]. The ferrocement layer is reinforced with wire meshes and fibers to improve its tensile strength and crack resistance. The mortar matrix is usually rich in cement and has a water-cement ratio of 0.4 to 0.5[^1^][2].</p>
<p>Ferrocement canal lining can be constructed using different methods, such as dry-mix method, plastic mix method, shotcrete method, or precast method[^1^][2]. The choice of the method depends on the availability of materials, equipment, labor, and site conditions.</p>
